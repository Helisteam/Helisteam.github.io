                Hello, my name is Brives Nathan and I currently am a first year BUT student in Network and Telecommunication, and this here is my introduction portfolio.<br>
                I decided to code it entierly by myself in HTML ,I hope you will not mind it if there are any minor imperfections.

                "I have always been very curious, and as I grew up, I was able to discover what aroused my curiosity the most: new technologies, whether it's computers, the internet, phones, and so on. <br>
                I always wanted to learn more about how they work, and I discovered a great interest in networks: being able to communicate with someone on the other side of the world, discovering a plethora of information and stories, being able to follow the news of countries I didn't even know existedâ€” all of this fascinated me. <br>
                I was able to explore this field during an open day as well as an immersion day, which solidified my choice to join the R&T (Network et Telecommunications) program.
